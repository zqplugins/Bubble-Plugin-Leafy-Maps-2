With this, you can allow interactivity between a page that is inside a popup, for example if you want the user to press a button inside the popup and then to trigger a workflow with a specific information from within the popup, this is how you do it. For example the user can click \"Book house\" inside a page inside a popup and then in your host page, which is the one showing the map, you bring some data based on that specific database object. Usually you will pass a unique ID to be used in the host page. Once the data is sent, it will be published in a state of the Leafy Map and trigger an event. Right now they are called: \"Popup sent data to host page\" and \"Data from popup\". Or maybe you want to send a command text, like \"accept\" or \"book X\". Also you can send in consolidated data in a single text and split it in the host page using the \"split\" operator. Be creative, you are a developer! (:",
